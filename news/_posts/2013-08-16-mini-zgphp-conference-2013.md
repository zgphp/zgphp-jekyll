As second anniversary of ZgPHP meetups is coming soon, we decided to organize a
mini PHP conference in Zagreb, **first PHP conference in this region**. It will
be held in Croatian Chamber of Economy, Nova Cesta 7, Zagreb on September 14th.
With help of our co-organizers, **Croatian Chamber of Economy** and **Croatian
Society for Open Systems and Internet** and **sponsors** we are able to giveaway
first 80 tickets!

ZgPHP meetups have started as a regular monthly meetups in September of 2011,
since then we have held **23 meetups**, 16 of them included talks (usually 2 of
them). Most of talks in last year have been recorded and are [available to
everybody interested](/talks/).

On our mailing lists, Facebook & Twitter we have around 250 members, in average
we have 25 visitors on each of our monthly meetups and for mini conference we
are hoping to gather 120 PHP developers (not only Zagreb but Croatia, Serbia,
Bosnia & Herzegovina, Slovenia ...).

## Talks

Though we already have respectable list of talkers from the region, we are still
looking for few more. If you are interested, contact us on zgphpmeetup [at]
gmail [dot] com, with title and short description of your talk and short
biography. We are able to help with costs (up to a point though, please contact
us for details) or we can put your company as one of sponsors if you would
prefer it that way. Call for paper is opened till August 25th, 2013.

## Sponsors

We are expecting around **120 visitors**, with help of sponsors by now we are
able to giveaway 80 tickets for 0 EURO's to interested visitors and we are
hoping to be able to provide everybody with such a ticket. We are a non-profit
conference, all of the proceeds that we are able to gather will go **only to
cost of organizing a conference**: travel expenses, food and beverages &
equipment needed. If you are interested, contact us for more details by email:
zgphpmeetup [at] gmail [dot] com.
